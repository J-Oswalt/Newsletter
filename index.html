        <h3 class="topic">Schoolwide Anti-Bullying Initiative</h3>
        <article>School-wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a framework to promote positive behaviors in schools. (Goodman-Scott et al, 2013) Schools that have initiated PBIS have behavior teams that decide on school-wide expectations. </article>
        <br />
        <article>Bully Prevention in Positive Behavior Support (BP-PBS) is part of PBIS. (Goodman-Scott et al, 2013) BP-PBS builds on PBIS and is an intervention for bullying. School personnel are trained in PBIS and teach the children how to handle situations that make them uncomfortable or afraid. Students are taught a three-step approach to address bullying called Stop/Walk/Talk. When a student is being disrespected, they will ask the offending student to stop. If it does not stop, the student will walk away and go to an adult and tell them what is happening. </article>
        <br />
        <article>It is important for adults to respond appropriately. (Goodman-Scott et al, 2013) Having proper training of school personnel, who in turn train the children proper protocols of BP-PBS will help develop a safe environment for all students and help prevent bullying incidents. Schools that implement PBIS have had fewer discipline referrals and suspensions. It is important to start training students in early childhood education classrooms. The earlier the students learn how to handle bullying situations, the better they will be able to handle bullying throughout their academic careers. </article>

        <h3 class="topic">Social Emotional Learning</h3>
        <article>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) has become an important part of the classroom learning environment. (Conners-Burrow et al, 2016) SEL skills are needed to interact positively with others and manage emotions, especially in the environment with peers. For example, we can teach students in an age-appropriate way hot to identify and voice their emotions. This is crucial to helping them develop coping skills that will help them throughout their lives. </article>
        <br />
        <article>We also build relationships with the student by engaging them in meaningful activities. Studies show that having a positive classroom environment and quality interactions between teachers and students help build healthy social and emotional development in students. </article>

        <h3 class="topic">Communication method</h3>
        <article>At Harbour View Elementary School, we want to have easy communication tools to keep a strong, appropriate, and open communication method between parents and teachers. We use Class Dojo (<a href="www.classdojo.com">www.classdojo.com</a>) as our communication platform that links between school and home.</article>
        <br />
        <article>Class Dojo makes it easy to communicate with the teacher. You can message the teacher at anytime and she will receive the message and will be able to respond back. It is private and no one else will be able to access it. In turn, the teacher will be able to contact you for any need that may arise. Another advantage of this platform is the ability to keep everyone in the classroom apprised of any event or activity that the entire class needs to know about. Only parents assigned to the classroom can see any post in the classroom or stories section of the application. </article>
        <br />
        <article>We look forward to building strong relationships with our families and look forward to getting to know you and your families. </article>

        <h3 class="topic">STEM</h3>
        <article>Have you ever watched your child build with blocks? Did you notice how much they concentrate to determine where to place each block so that it will be balanced and proportioned correctly? Block play is a part of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Block play and other STEM activities are crucial for young children and their development. (McClure et al, 2017) STEM activities can be interwoven into current curriculum as well as playtimes. Teachers should be sure to incorporate these activities throughout the school day. Teachers and parents should expose their students to museums, libraries, and technology. Engaging the students in brief instruction while there can be very helpful in the students learning and interest. Parents are also very important to the growth of their children and can encourage interest in STEM activities. Families can grow plants, tend gardens, and engage in art activities that encourage critical thinking. For example, they can build a catapult and send marshmallows flying or tye dye a t-shirt to wear to school. It is important to incorporate STEM activities in young children so that they will grow up and be able to compete in this new digital age. Parents and teachers can work together to help all of our students be successful. </article>

        <h3 class="topic">Importance of play</h3>
        <article>Nowadays, academics seem to be the focus of everything in the classroom. This being the case, we cannot forget the role play has in a child’s learning process. (Singer, 2013) Play may be discounted as children doing nothing and there is no use for it. That is the farthest thing from the truth. </article>
        <br />
        <article>Play is the most important learning tool in childhood. It teaches so many skills that we all need in a fun and non-threatening way. Through play, children learn to express themselves, problem solve, and they learn social skills. Play is a great way and best way to learn skills without realizing that you are learning. For example, building with Legos teaches basic science and engineering skills. It teaches problem-solving skills, and it helps with focus. </article>
        <br />
        <article>Not only does play help with academics, but it is also crucial for a child’s health and well-being. Playing is a physical and healthy activity that keeps children active and helps develop gross- and fine-motor skills that every child needs to grow into healthy adults. </article>
        <br />
        <article>As you can see, play plays an essential part in healthy child development. It is also fun and a great way to learn. </article>
